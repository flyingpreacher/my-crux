HERE IS WHAT I MUST DO EACH TIME TO AVOID/LESSEN COMPILING ERRORS"
1. GET SOFTWARE PACKAGE REQUIREMENTS
2. WRITE THEM DOWN (so I don't lose track of my focus)
3. TRY TO FIND DEPS IN CRUX LINUX REPOS
4. IF CRUX DOES NOT HAVE IT, DOWNLOAD SOURCE CODE AND COMPILE. (always read the dependency list for the source code from the original site. Some of the deps may have changed.)

tar -zxvf <file_name> (HOW TO EXTRACT SOURCE CODE FILES)


#Problem: I am trying to find a way to print out the currently installed packages on my CRUX Linux Installation. In order to do that, I must have printer drivers. This means I need to install hplip.

What are the minimum system requirements for HPLIP?
Answer: 

    + Linux kernel 2.4.19 and above (2.6.x recommended).
    + GNU software tools are required to build from source code. This includes the ANSI C compiler, ANSI C++ compiler and POSIX compliant environment.
    + libusb 0.1.8 or higher.
    - GPL Ghostscript 7.05 or higher.
    - Foomatic 3.0.2 or higher.
    - Qt 3.x or higher for UI toolkit.
    - PyQt 3.14 or higher for Qt wrapper for Python.
    + Python 2.2 or higher and python-devel (Python 2.3+ for fax support)
    - Reportlab (optional-provides fax cover page support)
    + CUPS 1.1.15 or higher and cups-devel.
    - libjpeg 6b or higher and libjpeg-devel.
    - net-snmp 5.0.9 or higher and net-snmp-devel for network support.
    + CUPS DDK 1.2 or higher for dynamic PPD support.

Ok, here we go. What do I have?
+ means I already have it
- means I have to compile/install it
